# android_device_meizu_m3s
Device repository for Meizu M3s (CyanogenMod)

Fork of https://github.com/divis1969/android_device_meizu_meilan2
===========================

Getting Started
---------------

Initialize a repository with CyanogenMode:

    repo init -u git://github.com/divis1969/android.git -b meilan2

Optinally use a specific manifest (not a tip):

    repo init -u git://github.com/divis1969/android.git -b meilan2 -m meilan2-cm-12.1-v0.14.xml

Note: 7 more Cyanogen repositories were forked since v0.2, so if you will encounter an error while syncing on top
of exiting tree, use the suggestion from the error log (sync those repos with --force-sync) 

Add /proc/ged in FD whitelist in frameworks/base/core/jni/fd_utils-inl.h
